# Project Plan: Nutrition AI (NA)

**Version:** 5.0  
**Status:** In Development  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## 1. Introduction & Core Principles

This document is the single source of truth for the development of the Nutrition AI (NA) application. It provides a detailed, sequential roadmap from inception to deployment following a strict backend-first approach with security and best practices at its core.

### Core Development Principles

- **Backend-First Development:** ALL backend development must be completed, tested, and documented before ANY frontend development begins. This ensures API stability and prevents rework.

- **Security by Design:** Every feature must incorporate security best practices from the start, including input validation, authentication, rate limiting, and secure data handling.

- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests before implementation. Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for backend and 70% for frontend.

- **Atomic Commits:** Each numbered step in this plan should correspond to a single Git commit following Conventional Commits specification.

- **Documentation Driven:** Update documentation in the same commit that introduces changes. This includes API docs, README files, and inline code comments.

- **Progressive Validation:** Each step must pass validation criteria before proceeding to the next step.
