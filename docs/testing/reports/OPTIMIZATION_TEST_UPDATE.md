# Optimization Changes - Test Status Update

## Date: 2025-07-14

### Frontend Testing Infrastructure Fix

**Problem**: 94.9% of frontend tests were failing due to StyleSheet.create() mock issue.

**Root Cause**: 
- The Button component and others use a pattern where `StyleSheet.create()` is called inside a `createStyles(theme)` function
- The jest mock was not handling this pattern correctly

**Solution Applied**:
1. Updated `jest.setup.js` to properly handle both object and function patterns in StyleSheet.create
2. Added missing Expo module mocks:
   - expo-image-picker
   - expo-modules-core
   - expo-camera
3. Set EXPO_OS environment variable

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/jest.setup.js`

**Expected Outcome**:
- Frontend tests should now be able to render components without StyleSheet errors
- The 94.9% failure rate should significantly improve

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `npm test` in the frontend directory to verify the fix
2. Update individual test files if needed for any remaining issues
3. Aim to achieve at least 80% test pass rate

### Backend Test Status

**Current Status**: 90.7% pass rate (107/118 tests passing)

**Optimizations Applied That May Affect Tests**:
1. Database indexes added - should not affect tests
2. Django admin optimization - should not affect tests
3. Security headers added to production settings - tests use testing settings
4. Environment variable validation enhanced - may affect deployment tests

**Recommendation**: Run backend tests after applying migrations to ensure indexes don't cause issues.

### Testing Commands Reference

**Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
python run_tests.py --coverage
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Impact on CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs. This should make the CI/CD pipeline more flexible and maintainable.
